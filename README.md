# Visionary Ventures Information System

## OVERVIEW
Madison County Government has requested a collaborative information system for aid in strategic business-decision making and information reporting.
This solution was designed by Visionary Ventures for this direct purpose, and offers a substantial amount of functionality. This prototype also offers many features that will be built upon, enhanced, and made to conform to all of Madison County's needs.

## HOW TO USE
INSTRUCTIONS

Python
Explanation: We used Python to perform our regression analysis functions. In the near future, Python will not be required
			on a local machine to run this program. For now however, Python must be installed on your local machine.
1. Go to command prompt
2. Enter the following command: pip install pandas statsmodels matplotlib openpyxl

SQL Server Management Studio
1. In SQL Server Management Studio, create one database called "Sprint2" and one database called "AUTH".
2. Run: "Sprint2DB_TableCreationAndPopulation" for the Sprint2 database.
3. Run: "AUTHTableCreationAndPopulation" for AUTH database.
4. Run: "SPLogin_Sprint2" for AUTH database.
